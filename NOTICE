BashKit

This product is an independent implementation of a sandboxed bash interpreter.

================================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
================================================================================

BashKit is an independent implementation that draws design inspiration from
several open source projects. We gratefully acknowledge:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
just-bash

Copyright (c) Vercel Inc.
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0

Repository: https://github.com/vercel/just-bash

BashKit's sandboxing architecture and multi-tenant design was inspired by
just-bash's approach to safe bash execution. No code was copied; this is an
independent Rust implementation.

Oils (formerly Oil Shell)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repository: https://github.com/oilshell/oil

The Oils project's comprehensive bash compatibility testing approach inspired
our spec test methodology. Our test cases are independently written following
similar testing principles.

One True AWK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright (c) Lucent Technologies
Licensed under the Lucent Public License

Repository: https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk

The behavior and semantics of our AWK builtin implementation are informed by
the One True AWK specification. Our implementation is written from scratch in
Rust using the original AWK language definition as reference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jq
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copyright (c) Stephen Dolan
Licensed under the MIT License

Repository: https://github.com/jqlang/jq

Our jq builtin aims for compatibility with jq's query syntax and behavior.
The implementation uses the jaq Rust crates (MIT licensed) rather than jq
source code directly.
